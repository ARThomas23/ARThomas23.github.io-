            <p class="p1">Bodoni was drawn by London based type designer Dave Farey for Lanston Type during one of his alter-ego bouts as Giambattista Bodoni in the early 1990s. This font presents the unusual opportunity to use a Bodoni as body copy. Bodoni Bold is offered in four variations with three different types of numerals: Lining, French Oldstyle (Fournier) & Small Cap Lining Figures or with all options combined into one OpenType font.</p>

            <p class="p2"></p> <br>Giambattista Bodoni created this modern typeface in 1790 which served as the structural model for Sol Hess's faithful rendition. Hess made necessary adjustments for mechanical typesetting on Lanston's Monotype composition system. Remastered in 2006 by Paul Hunt, Bodoni Pro features lining and oldstyle figure plus a set of "French oldstyle" figures. The Pro version also includes: long descender option, small caps, ligatures and a Central European Character set.</p>
